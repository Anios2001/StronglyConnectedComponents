# StronglyConnectedComponent
This is my implementation of Strongly Connected Components in C++ language. This is a walkthrough of the code.
<h1>Vertex.cpp</h1> defines a vertex and edge of graph
<h1>Directed Graph.cpp</h1> defines a directed graph including Vertex and edges from Vertex.cpp

<h1>ReverseGraph.cpp</h1> contains a algo to reverse the graph
<h1>StronglyConnectedComponent.cpp</h1> contains Kosaraju's Algo, DFS LOOP and DFS on Graph.
If you want any more information please comment down. 
<h1>PROBLEM</h1>
The problem i am facing is that i am unable to take a large no of input edges like 1,00,000 records. It ran fine on 10,000 input edges and passed all test cases posted on Discussion Forum.
<h2>File IO</h2>
I have used <b>ifstream</b> and <b>getline</b> to take input.
